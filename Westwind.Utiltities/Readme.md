#Westwind.Utiltities
###A rich library of everyday utilities for .NET development###

*** This is version 2.0 of the West Wind Toolkit that is still
*** under full construction.  This version heavily refactors
*** the older versions and breaks components out more logically
*** and also puts components out on GitHub under their
*** separate library trees.

For the moment this library will be hosted here in source code only 
format.

Every application requires common small repeated tasks to be accomplished
repeatedly. This library is a collection of those things that I need on
a regular basis and have compiled over the years. 

It includes tools for:

* String manipulation, extraction, abstracts, parsing, replacement etc.
* Configuration settings management with strongly typed classes
* Basic logging features
* A simple Data Access Layer that thinly wraps ADO net
* Many data access helpers for parsing data to objects and dynamics
* Type and Data conversions for Reflection
* Simple object serialization
* File, Path and System Utilties

and much, much more.

It's worthwhile to browse through the source code or the documentation
to find out the myriad of useful functionality that is available, all
in a small single assembly.

This assembly is the base for most other West Wind libraries.
