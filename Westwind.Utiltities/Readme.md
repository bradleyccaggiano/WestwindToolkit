#Westwind.Utiltities
###A rich library of everyday utilities for .NET development###

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;margin-left: 15px;font-style: italic">
This is version 2.0 of the West Wind Toolkit that is still
under full construction.  This version heavily refactors
the older versions, breaks components out more logically
and also puts components out on GitHub under their
separate library trees.

Every .NET application requires small, common and ofen repeated tasks.
This library is a collection of those things that I commonly need on
a regular basis and have compiled over the years.

It includes tools for:

* Configuration settings management with strongly typed classes
* A small database drive logging engine
* A simple Data Access Layer that thinly wraps ADO net
* Many data access helpers for parsing data to objects and dynamics
* Many helper classes with utility features:
	* StringUtils
	* ReflectionUtils
	* SerializationUtils
	* DataUtils
	* EncryptionUtils
	* FileUtils

and much, much more.

It's worthwhile to browse through the source code or the documentation
to find out the myriad of useful functionality that is available, all
in a small single assembly.

This assembly is the base for most other West Wind libraries.
