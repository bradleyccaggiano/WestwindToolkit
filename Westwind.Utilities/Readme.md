#Westwind.Utiltities
###A rich library of everyday utilities for .NET development###

Every .NET application requires small, common and ofen repeated tasks.
This library is a collection of those things that I commonly need on
a regular basis and have compiled over the years.

* [Get it on NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/Westwind.Utilities/)
* [Usage Documentation](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?page=_3rg13chn1.htm)
* [Class Documentation](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs/_3rg13chn1.htm)

It includes tools for:

* [**Application Configuration**](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?page=_2le027umn.htm) class to create code-first strongly typed configuration classes for your applications
* [**Lightweight ADO.NET Data Access Layer**](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?=page=_3ou0v2jum.htm) ideal for components or apps
  that need data access but don't need the bulk of Entity Framework or similar ORM
* [**Application Logging**](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?page=_2mp013ssr.htm) that is integrated and easy to use and configure
* **General Purpose Utility Classes**:
	* [StringUtils](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20StringUtils)
    * [HtmlUtils](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20HtmlUtils)
	* [ReflectionUtils](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20ReflectionUtils)
	* [SerializationUtils](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20SerializationUtils)
	* [DataUtils](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20DataUtils)	
	* [FileUtils](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20FileUtils)
    * [TimeUtils](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20TimeUtils)	
    * [XmlUtils](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20TimeUtils)	    
    * [StringSerializer](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20StringSerializer)
    * [Expando](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20Expando)
	* [PropertyBag](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20PropertyBag)
    * [Scheduler](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20Scheduler) (for background processing)    
    * [DelegateFactory](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?topic=Class%20DelegateFactory)

and much, much more.

It's worthwhile to browse through the source code or the documentation
to find out the myriad of useful functionality that is available, all
in a small single assembly.

This assembly is the base for most other West Wind libraries.
