#Westwind.Utiltities
###A rich library of everyday utilities for .NET development###

Every .NET application requires small, common and ofen repeated tasks.
This library is a collection of those things that I commonly need on
a regular basis and have compiled over the years.

* [Get it on NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/Westwind.Utilities/)
* [Usage Documentation](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs?page=_3rg13chn1.htm)
* [Class Documentation](http://west-wind.com/westwindtoolkit/docs/_3rg13chn1.htm)

It includes tools for:

* **Application Configuration** class to create code-first strongly typed configuration classes for your applications
* A small, extensible logging engine with built-in Database and Xml support
* **Lightweight ADO.NET Data Access Layer** ideal for components or apps
  that need data access but don't need the bulk of Entity Framework or similar ORM
* **Application Logging** that is integrated and easy to use and configure
* **General Purpose Utility Classes**:
	* StringUtils
    * HtmlUtils
	* ReflectionUtils
	* SerializationUtils
	* DataUtils
	* EncryptionUtils
	* FileUtils
    * TimeUtils
    * XmlUtils    
    * StringSerializer
    * Expando
    * Scheduler (for background processing)    
    * DelegateFactory

and much, much more.

It's worthwhile to browse through the source code or the documentation
to find out the myriad of useful functionality that is available, all
in a small single assembly.

This assembly is the base for most other West Wind libraries.
