#West Wind Toolkit
###A rich library of utilities for Web and everyday development###

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;margin-left: 15px;font-style: italic">
This is version 2.0 of the West Wind Toolkit that is still
under full construction.  This version heavily refactors
the older versions, organizes components more logically
distributes the entire project on GitHub under their
separate library trees.
</div>
For the moment this library will be hosted here in source code only 
format without NuGet components, but you can grab the source to
compile it or the binaries from the /libs folder.

The main components of the West Wind Toolkit are:

* Westwind.Utilities - Core utilities and helper classes for all aspects of .NET
* Westwind.Data - Business Object wrapper for Entity Framework Code First
* Westwind.Web - Core ASP.NET helpers and components
* Westwind.Web.Mvc - MVC specific helpers and components
* Westwind.Web.WebForms - WebForms helpers and controls (not included yet)
